# amazon-price-tracker
This amazon price tracker checks the price every -- seconds and if it increased or decreased it updates you by sending an email or showing in the app. [TO USE (IMPORTANT): use pip to install resend, threading, requests, BeautifulSoup, customtkinter and python obviously]  I custom made this, tho the email sender and GUI was vibe coded, if you want to use the code. Make sure to replace the API key at the start with a Resend API key, or else emails wont be sent, If the code doesn't work open it in the python IDLE and then run it. enjoy!
